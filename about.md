I've just finished my graduate studies. After spending 2.5 years in the PhD program at the [database group](https://db.cs.washington.edu/), at UW Allen School of Computer Science, advised by [Dan Suciu](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~suciu/), I decided to leave with M.S and work in industry. During my PhD, I focused on data systems and machine learning, specifically on join processing, and natural languge interfaces for querying knowledge graphs.

### Brief bio

Prior to moving to UW, I studied Mathematics and Computer Science at UCLA. There, I was fortunate to work with [Guy Van den Broeck](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~guyvdb/) and do research on inference in probabilistic models as a member of [Statistical Relational AI Lab](http://starai.cs.ucla.edu/).
During all four years, I taught mathematics to a group of high-school students at the [UCLA Olga Radko Endowed
Math Circle](https://circles.math.ucla.edu/circles/). I was also part of [Upsilon Pi Epsilon](https://upe.seas.ucla.edu/), and DevX - a student-led organization focusing on building useful things for the community at UCLA. We built an app that tracks crowdedness of libraries on campus in real time. 

### Work experience
I've also worked in a bunch of places!

Most recently, I interned at [RelationalAI](https://relational.ai/), where I was integrating a novel query compiler into the main query processing engine. RelationalAI team is fantastic! 

I also worked at [AWS Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/) for two summers in a row. First time, I worked on [bringing ML into the data warehouse](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/aws-announces-amazon-redshift-ml-preview/). It was a very fun internship! 
Next summer, I returned to Redshift again; this time, I was working on optimizing autoscaling configurations as a step to enable [Redshift Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/redshift-serverless/). I also interned at NAND Capital, a trading startup, which was an exciting experience learning about financial markets. Here, I primarily researched and implemented options pricing models and ivol prediction. Finally, I interned at [Yandex](https://yandex.ru/company/) optimizing the logic for establishing TLS handshakes. 

I grew up in Moscow, Russia.
