I am currently a PhD student at the UW Allen School of Computer Science, advised by Dan Suciu. 

### Research interests

My interests lie broadly in data systems and machine learning. 
Currently I'm focusing on optimizing join processing algorithms in relational database systems
by using worst-case optimal join techniques. 

### Brief bio

Before my PhD, I studied Mathematics and Computer Science at University of California, Los Angeles. 
There, I did research on inference in probabilistic models in the StarAI lab with
great Guy Van den Broeck. I also was a lead instructor at the UCLA Olga Radko Endowed
Math Circle, teaching a group of high-schol students mathematics.

I interned at AWS Redshift where I worked on bringing Machine Learning capabilities
into the data warehouse.
Before that, I interned at Yandex in the Search Product, in the Notifications team working on optimizing establishing TLS connections. 
I also interned at NAND Capital startup where I researched and implemented options pricing models
and price volatility estimation techniques. 

I grew up in Moscow, Russia.
