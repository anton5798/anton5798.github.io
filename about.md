I am currently a PhD student at the UW Allen School of Computer Science, advised by [Dan Suciu](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~suciu/).

### Research interests

My interests lie broadly in data systems and machine learning. 
Currently I'm focusing on optimizing join processing algorithms in relational database systems
by using worst-case optimal join techniques. 

### Brief bio

Before my PhD, I studied Mathematics and Computer Science at UCLA. 
There, I did research on inference in probabilistic models in the [Statistical Relational AI Lab](http://starai.cs.ucla.edu/) and was fortunate to work with [Guy Van den Broeck](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~guyvdb/). I also was a lead instructor at the [UCLA Olga Radko Endowed
Math Circle](https://circles.math.ucla.edu/circles/), teaching mathematics to a group of high-school students.

I interned at [AWS Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/) where I worked on [bringing ML into the data warehouse](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/aws-announces-amazon-redshift-ml-preview/).
Before that, I interned at [Yandex](https://yandex.ru/company/) optimizing the logic for establishing TLS handshakes. 
I also interned at a fintech startup where I researched and implemented options pricing models and price volatility estimation techniques. 

I grew up in Moscow, Russia.
