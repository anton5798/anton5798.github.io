### Hey! Welcome to my webpage!

I am Anton. I am a senior at UCLA doing Computer Science & Mathematics.
I'm doing research in [Statistical Relational AI lab](http://starai.cs.ucla.edu/) at UCLA.
Besides, I am teaching extracurricullar topics in mathematics to high school students at [LA Math Circle](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~radko/circles/index.shtml?).
